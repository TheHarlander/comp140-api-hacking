Base repository for the COMP140 API Hacking assignment



There are many Python twitter API libaries out there, some more complete than others.
The two main libaries I looked at were Tweepy and Twython. Although similar in nature, I found Tweepy to be more straight forward 
for what I want to achieve. Tweepy comes with a widely detailed instrctions on how to set up a  basic twitter application, with even more detailed instructions for more advanced programming. With Tweepy you are able to write Python code that interacts with the API without having to manipulate raw HHTP requests in the code, It also has a secure OAuth protocol.
